# bustools R notebooks

This repository has example notebooks that demonstrate usage of [`kallisto bus`](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/673285v1) to generate gene count or (transcript compatibility count) TCC matrices from FASTQ files and some basic downstream analyses. To run the notebooks, please install [kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/starting), [bustools](https://github.com/BUStools/bustools), and the [BUSpaRse](https://github.com/BUStools/BUSpaRse) R package. 

## Notebooks

1. [1k 1:1 Mixture of Fresh Frozen Human (HEK293T) and Mouse (NIH3T3) Cells (10x v2 chemistry); demonstration of `bustools`](https://bustools.github.io/BUS_notebooks_R/10xv2.html)
2. [1k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor (10x v3 chemistry); demonstration of `TENxBUSData` and `BUSpaRse`](https://bustools.github.io/BUS_notebooks_R/10xv3.html)
3. RNA velocity with 10k E18 mouse neurons from 10x (coming soon)
4. Differential expression with equivalence classes in TCC matrix (coming soon)
