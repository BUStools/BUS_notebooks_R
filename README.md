# BUStoolsR notebooks

This repository has example notebooks that demonstrate how to go from fastq files to sparse matrices for scRNA-seq data from start to end. To run the notebooks, please install [kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/starting), [bustools](https://github.com/BUStools/bustools), and the [BUStoolsR](https://github.com/lambdamoses/BUStoolsR) R package. 

These are the notebooks:
