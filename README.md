# BUSpaRse notebooks

This repository has example notebooks that demonstrate how to go from fastq files to sparse matrices for scRNA-seq data from start to end. To run the notebooks, please install [kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/starting), [bustools](https://github.com/BUStools/bustools), and the [BUSpaRse](https://github.com/lambdamoses/BUSpaRse) R package. 

These are the notebooks:

1. [10x v2 chemistry - 1k 1:1 Mixture of Fresh Frozen Human (HEK293T) and Mouse (NIH3T3) Cells](https://lambdamoses.github.io/BUSpaRse_notebooks/10xv2.html)
2. 10x v3 chemistry - 1k 1:1 Mixture of Fresh Frozen Human (HEK293T) and Mouse (NIH3T3) Cells (coming soon)
